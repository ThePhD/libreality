libreality
==========

The GPL is not magic.

This piece of the Furrovine Engine that supports querying file contents and extensions to get their true type. If you want more files types to be supported, just make a pull request and add it to the `reality.cpp` file.

Meant to be a FOSS replacement for the lame and annoying GPLv2 version of "libmagic".
